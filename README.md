Langauge Chosen: Python

How to Run: To run the matrix multiplication and the harness with 
graphing, run the MatrixTest.py file. 

The run terminal will show the products from the multipleExample() function and 
below that the harness results (from compareTime() function) will display the 
averages for the given sizes.

Notes:
multipleExample() - You can control the size of the matrices inside the function 
compareTime()     - You can control the repeats inside the function and the
                    sizes at the bottom of the MatrixTest file in array named "sizes"
